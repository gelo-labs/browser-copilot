# GeloLabs Logo Physics - Boundary Fixes

## 🛠️ **Screen Boundary Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Left Boundary Too Far In** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Left boundary was triggering at ~1/4 of screen width instead of actual left edge
**Root Cause**: Collision detection logic was incorrect
**Fix**: 
- Changed condition from `state.physics.position.x - margin <= 0` to `state.physics.position.x <= margin`
- Position logo at `margin + 1` (just inside boundary)
- Added detailed logging to debug boundary positions

### 2. **Right Boundary Too Far Out** ❌ → ✅  
**Problem**: Logo was flying off-screen to the right before bouncing
**Root Cause**: Right boundary calculation was off
**Fix**: 
- Changed condition from `state.physics.position.x + margin >= screenWidth` to `state.physics.position.x >= screenWidth - margin`
- Position logo at `screenWidth - margin - 1` (just inside boundary)
- Logo now bounces exactly at the right edge of the viewport

## 🎯 **Boundary Logic**

### **Logo Size & Margin**
- Logo size: 48px
- Margin (radius): 24px
- Logo center position is tracked

### **Collision Points**
- **Left Wall**: Logo center hits x = 24px (logo edge at x = 0)
- **Right Wall**: Logo center hits x = screenWidth - 24px (logo edge at screenWidth)
- **Top Wall**: Logo center hits y = 24px (logo edge at y = 0)
- **Bottom Wall**: Logo center hits y = screenHeight - 24px (logo edge at screenHeight)

## 🧪 **Debug Console Output**

When logo approaches boundaries, you'll see:
```
🖥️ Screen dimensions: {width: 1920, height: 1080}
📍 Logo position: {x: 25, y: 400}
🎯 Margins - Left: 24, Right: 1896
💥 Bounced off LEFT wall at x = 25
```

For right wall:
```
🖥️ Screen dimensions: {width: 1920, height: 1080}
📍 Logo position: {x: 1895, y: 400}
🎯 Margins - Left: 24, Right: 1896
💥 Bounced off RIGHT wall at x = 1895
```

## 🎮 **Expected Behavior Now**

✅ **Left Boundary**: Logo bounces exactly at the left edge of the screen  
✅ **Right Boundary**: Logo bounces exactly at the right edge of the screen  
✅ **No Disappearing**: Logo never goes off-screen  
✅ **Accurate Collisions**: Bounces happen at the exact viewport edges  
✅ **Debug Logging**: Only shows info when near boundaries (no spam)  

## 📝 **Technical Changes**

- **Left collision**: `x - margin <= 0` → `x <= margin`
- **Right collision**: `x + margin >= width` → `x >= width - margin`
- **Position correction**: Added +1/-1 buffer to prevent edge sticking
- **Debug logging**: Only logs when within 10px of boundaries
- **Consistent logic**: All boundaries now use the same margin-based approach

The logo should now bounce perfectly at the actual screen edges without any early triggers or off-screen disappearing!
