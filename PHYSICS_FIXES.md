# GeloLabs Logo Physics - Bug Fixes

## 🛠️ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Auto-Centering After Timer** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Logo was automatically returning to center position after 5 seconds
**Solution**: Removed the failsafe timeout completely - physics runs naturally now

### 2. **Horrible Glow Effects** ❌ → ✅  
**Problem**: Blue and green glow effects were distracting
**Solution**: Removed all `filter: drop-shadow()` effects from CSS

### 3. **Dragging Not Working Properly** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Logo wasn't following cursor, would freeze and then "remember" movements
**Solution**: 
- Fixed position calculation to follow cursor directly
- Improved velocity smoothing (0.5 instead of 0.7/0.3)
- Logo now moves smoothly with cursor during drag

### 4. **Gravity Too Strong** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Gravity was 0.5, making logo fall almost vertically
**Solution**: Reduced gravity to 0.2 for more realistic physics

### 5. **Magnetic Snap Too Aggressive** ❌ → ✅
**Problem**: Logo would snap back too easily, causing unwanted centering
**Solution**: 
- Made magnetic snap more restrictive (speed < 2, distance < 20)
- Snap doesn't disable physics anymore, just resets position
- Keeps physics enabled after snap

## 🎮 **Current Behavior**

✅ **Page Load**: Logo spins once, then becomes draggable  
✅ **Dragging**: Logo follows cursor smoothly, no freezing  
✅ **Physics**: Realistic gravity (0.2), natural falling motion  
✅ **Bouncing**: Clean bounces off walls and elements  
✅ **Magnetic Snap**: Only when very close (20px) and very slow (speed < 2)  
✅ **No Auto-Reset**: Logo stays where you leave it  
✅ **Clean Visuals**: No glow effects, clean appearance  

## 🧪 **Testing Commands**

```javascript
// Test physics (should work smoothly now)
GeloLabsSpinner.testPhysics();

// Manual controls
GeloLabsSpinner.enablePhysics();   // Enable dragging
GeloLabsSpinner.resetPosition();   // Manual reset only

// Check status
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({action: 'gelolabs:getStatus'});
```

## 📝 **Technical Changes**

- **Gravity**: 0.5 → 0.2
- **Velocity smoothing**: 0.7/0.3 → 0.5/0.5  
- **Magnetic snap**: speed < 5 → speed < 2, distance < 50 → distance < 20
- **Failsafe timer**: Removed completely
- **Glow effects**: All removed
- **Snap behavior**: Keeps physics enabled after snap
- **Position updates**: Direct cursor following during drag

The logo now behaves like a real physical object that you can throw around, with realistic gravity and bouncing, without any annoying auto-resets or visual distractions!
