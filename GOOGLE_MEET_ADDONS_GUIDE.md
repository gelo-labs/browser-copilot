# Google Meet Add-ons Guide

## Current Situation

The Chrome extension approach for Google Meet is being actively blocked by Google's Content Security Policy (CSP). The console messages indicate:

- **"Developing an extension for Meet? Better create an add-on"**
- **"Extensions can cause problems by changing the page"**
- **Google recommends using their official Add-ons system**

## Google Workspace Add-ons vs Chrome Extensions

### Chrome Extensions (Current Approach - Blocked)
- ❌ **Blocked by Google Meet CSP**
- ❌ Cannot inject scripts into Google Meet
- ❌ Cannot access meeting content directly
- ✅ Works on YouTube and other sites
- ✅ Full browser integration

### Google Workspace Add-ons (Recommended Alternative)
- ✅ **Officially supported by Google**
- ✅ Can access meeting data and transcripts
- ✅ Integrates directly with Google Meet UI
- ✅ Can capture real-time meeting information
- ✅ Access to speaker identification and timestamps
- ❌ Requires different development approach
- ❌ Limited to Google Workspace ecosystem

## Migration to Google Workspace Add-ons

### What Would Change

#### 1. **Development Framework**
```javascript
// Instead of Chrome Extension Manifest V3
// Use Google Workspace Add-ons framework
{
  "timeZone": "America/New_York",
  "dependencies": {
    "enabledAdvancedServices": []
  },
  "exceptionLogging": "STACKDRIVER",
  "runtimeVersion": "V8"
}
```

#### 2. **Meeting Data Access**
```javascript
// Google Workspace Add-ons can access:
- Real-time meeting transcripts
- Speaker identification
- Meeting metadata
- Participant information
- Timestamps and duration
```

#### 3. **UI Integration**
```javascript
// Instead of floating buttons, integrate into Meet UI:
- Sidebar panels
- Meeting controls
- Chat integration
- Settings integration
```

#### 4. **Deployment Process**
- **Current**: Chrome Web Store
- **New**: Google Workspace Marketplace
- **Approval**: Google Workspace team review
- **Distribution**: Through Google Workspace admin

### Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Research & Planning
1. **Study Google Workspace Add-ons Documentation**
   - [Google Meet Add-ons Guide](https://developers.google.com/meet/add-ons)
   - [Google Workspace Add-ons Framework](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/add-ons)

2. **Understand Available APIs**
   - Meeting transcript APIs
   - Speaker identification
   - Real-time data access
   - UI integration points

#### Phase 2: Development
1. **Create Add-on Project**
   ```bash
   # Use Google Apps Script
   # Or Google Workspace Add-ons SDK
   ```

2. **Implement Meeting Notes Feature**
   ```javascript
   // Access meeting data
   const transcript = meeting.getTranscript();
   const speakers = meeting.getParticipants();
   
   // Process and store notes
   const notes = processTranscript(transcript, speakers);
   saveNotes(notes);
   ```

3. **Create UI Components**
   ```javascript
   // Sidebar panel for notes
   const sidebar = CardService.newCardBuilder()
     .addSection(CardService.newCardSection()
       .addWidget(CardService.newTextParagraph()
         .setText("Meeting Notes")));
   ```

#### Phase 3: Testing & Deployment
1. **Test in Google Workspace Environment**
   - Use Google Meet test environment
   - Verify transcript capture
   - Test UI integration

2. **Submit to Google Workspace Marketplace**
   - Create listing
   - Submit for review
   - Wait for approval

## Advantages of Add-ons Approach

### ✅ **Official Support**
- Google actively supports and recommends this approach
- No CSP restrictions
- Direct access to meeting APIs

### ✅ **Better Integration**
- Native Google Meet UI integration
- Access to real-time meeting data
- Speaker identification built-in

### ✅ **Enhanced Features**
- Can access meeting metadata
- Participant information
- Meeting recording integration
- Chat integration possibilities

### ✅ **Professional Distribution**
- Google Workspace Marketplace
- Enterprise deployment options
- Admin-controlled installation

## Disadvantages

### ❌ **Development Complexity**
- Different framework to learn
- Google Apps Script limitations
- More complex deployment process

### ❌ **Limited Scope**
- Only works in Google Workspace
- Cannot block YouTube Shorts
- Platform-specific features

### ❌ **Approval Process**
- Google Workspace team review
- Longer approval times
- Stricter requirements

## Recommended Approach

### Option 1: Hybrid Solution
- **Keep Chrome Extension** for YouTube features
- **Create Separate Add-on** for Google Meet
- **Unified Branding** across both platforms

### Option 2: Full Migration
- **Migrate entirely** to Google Workspace Add-ons
- **Focus on meeting productivity** features
- **Leverage Google's ecosystem** advantages

### Option 3: Wait and Monitor
- **Keep current extension** for YouTube
- **Monitor Google Meet** for policy changes
- **Prepare for future** opportunities

## Next Steps

1. **Research Google Workspace Add-ons thoroughly**
2. **Evaluate development resources and timeline**
3. **Decide on hybrid vs full migration approach**
4. **Begin Add-ons development if proceeding**
5. **Maintain current extension for YouTube functionality**
